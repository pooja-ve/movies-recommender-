# Movie-Recommender-System
A Web Base user-item Movie Recommendation Engine using  cosine similarity  algorithm and The Recommendation systems; content-based filtering, two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. It is often used to measure document similarity in text analysis.  
I used this vectorization and not considering stop-words. After used natural language library nltk for apply stemming because 2 diffrent words on my data set.  
Then converted string into list total 4806 movies, 4806 vectors. By calculating distance 1 movie with another movie less distance more similarity.Calculating angle 1 movie with another movie.
cosine distance inversely proportional to similarity.  
Sort distances maximum similar movies comes first and less similar movies back. Then top 5 movies fetch and show.  
I sugguest  algorithm used  A Web Base user-item Movie Recommendation Engine using Collaborative Filtering By matrix factorizations algorithm and The recommendation based on the underlying idea that is if two persons both liked certian common movies,then the movies that one person has liked that the other person has not yet watched can be recommended to him.
